# Random Squares
A small project that demonstrates basic HTML, CSS, and JS skills. The page contains a 4x4 grid of cells that randomly changes the color of a random cell every 250ms. Once selected, that cell cannot be changed for 2000ms.

By default, frequency is 250ms, timeout is 2000ms, and an RGB color value can be within 0-255 (inclusive). Optional parameters can be passed through to use different values as desired.

## How to use
1. Clone repo to your working directory.
2. Ensure all three files (html, css, and js) are in the same directory.
3. Open index.html in the browser of your choice
4. Press 'START' to begin random coloring.
5. Press 'STOP' to stop random coloring.
