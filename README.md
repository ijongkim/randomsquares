# Random Squares
This is a small project that demonstrates basic HTML, CSS, and JS skills. The page contains a 4x4 grid of cells that randomly changes the color of a random cell every 250ms. Once selected, that cell cannot be changed for 2000ms.

Defaults for the frequency, timeout, and possible color values is set in the JS file. Options can be passed through to modify the default values.

## How to use

3. Open index.html in the browser of your choice
4. Press 'START' to begin random coloring.
5. Press 'STOP' to stop random coloring.
